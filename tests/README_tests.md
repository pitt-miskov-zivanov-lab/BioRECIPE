# BioRECIPE Translator Testing

This repository contains a set of testing scripts for each translator

#### Setup

Follow the Setup instructions in BioRECIPE README file.

##### Run Testing Scripts

```bash
python [test..translation.py]
```

Note: Due to the package conflicts of pandas & numpy between INDRA and other translators, please install the INDRA package following the command below to use our INDRA translator. We will fix this issue in future release version. 

```
pip install indra
```
