This tool takes as input a list of query proteins, and returns all STRING interactions between the query set.

To run this script, use the following command:
>python query_STRING.py [input_file.txt]

where the input file is a list of HUGO gene symbols separated by newline characters. 

The output is an Excel file containing the list of all STRING interactions occuring between any two input genes.
