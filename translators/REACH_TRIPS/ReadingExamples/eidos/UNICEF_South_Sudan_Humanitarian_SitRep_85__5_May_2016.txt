Highlights.

•  The  polio  National  Immunization  Days  (NIDs)  of  April  2016  have  so  far 
reached 2,601,535 children nationwide (87 per cent of the target), with 
delays  in  implementation  in  six  counties  in  the  conflict  affected  states, 
namely, Pibor, Pochalla, Khorflus, Ulang, Mundri East and Mundri West. 
In addition, to implement the global switch from tOPV to bOPV, UNICEF 
supported  transportation  and  distribution  of  434,000  doses  of  bOPV  to 
the seven stable states and 16 accessible counties out of 33 in the conflict-
affected states.

•  UNICEF  and  partners  have  admitted  53,775  children  for  severe  acute 
malnutrition  (SAM)  from  January  to  March  2016.  This  is  a  40  per  cent 
increase over the same time period in 2015 and a third of the 2016 target. 
Over a third of the children were admitted from Northern Bahr el Ghazal, 
where the number of outpatient therapeutic programmes (OTP) sites has 
been increased to 180, providing treatment to children with SAM.

•.

In Unity State, the “Beyond Bentiu” strategy is progressing as UNICEF opened 
four primary schools in Guit County for the first time since fighting erupted in 
December 2013.  So far  2,581  children  (40 per  cent  girls) are  attending  the 
schools. With  more  Back-to-Learning  2  (BTL  2)  campaigns taking place,  the 
target  of  5,000  children  should  be  realized.  Meanwhile,  the  majority  of 
schools remain closed in Koch County as most people who fled the area have 
not yet returned.

South Sudan SITUATION REPORT 5 MAY 2016.

Situation Overview & Humanitarian Needs  
Over 2.4 million people have been displaced since fighting broke out in Juba in December 2013. This includes 712,870 
people who have crossed into neighbouring countries. According to the UN Mission in South Sudan, the six Protection 
of Civilians (PoC) sites are currently sheltering 179,836 IDPs: 108,190 in Bentiu, 40,448 in Malakal, 27,990 in Juba, 2,289 
in Bor, 700 in Melut and 219 in Wau.

Following the much awaited arrival of the first Vice President in Juba, the South Sudan Transitional Government of 
National Unity (TGoNU) was formed on 28 April in accordance with the Peace Agreement signed in August 2015. During 
the  reporting  period,  the  security  situation  remained  relatively  calm  in  most  parts  of  the  country  except  for  some 
clashes  in  remote  locations  of  Western  Bahr  el  Ghazl  and  Western  Equatoria  States.  However,  the  humanitarian 
situation has continued to deteriorate due to multifaceted reasons such as tribal conflicts, the decline of the economy, 
the disruption of livelihoods and a poor harvest resulting in displacement.

Humanitarian leadership and coordination  
UNICEF  actively  participates  in  the  Humanitarian  Country  Team  and  the  Inter  Cluster  Working  Group,  which  lead 
strategic  and  cross-sectoral  coordination  of  humanitarian  programmes.  UNICEF  leads  the  WASH,  Nutrition  and 
Education clusters as well as the Child Protection sub-cluster. Within the Health cluster, UNICEF provides leadership on 
vaccination, communication and social mobilization. UNICEF also supports the core supply pipelines for the Education, 
WASH and Nutrition clusters, providing essential humanitarian supplies to all partners. While continuing to focus on 
the  delivery  of  life-saving  interventions,  UNICEF  is  also  investing  in  providing  access  to  education  and  a  protective 
environment for affected children.

Humanitarian Strategy: Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) 
As part of the Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) with WFP, UNICEF has reached 1,005,106 people, including 202,266 
children under 5, through 82 RRM missions with 11 conducted in 2016. A RRM mission is currently deployed in Biil, 
Guit  County  in  Unity  State  during  3-10  May.  The  RRM  strategy  is  currently  under  review,  assessing  changes  in  the 
security,  humanitarian  and  political  context  of  the  country.  Through  this  mechanism,  UNICEF  continues  to  serve 
populations in hard-to-reach areas with urgent and lifesaving intervention with partners.

Summary Analysis of Programme Response.

HEALTH: UNICEF continues to focus on health interventions that target diseases with the highest burden in terms of 
child health outcomes. The key activity areas are therefore immunization, control of malaria, preventive and curative 
consultations for children under 5, and care of pregnant women. For immunization, UNICEF supports the provision of 
vaccines and related supplies, cold chain equipment and social mobilization. In addition, resources and activities are 
also directed at diseases with epidemic potential that impact on children such as cholera.

The polio National Immunization Days (NIDs) of April 2016 have so far reached 2,601,535 children nationwide (87 per 
cent of the target), with delays in implementation in six counties of the conflict affected states, namely, Pibor, Pochalla, 
Khorflus, Ulang, Mundri East and Mundri West. In commemoration of African Vaccination Week (24-30 April), a scale-
up  campaign of routine immunization is ongoing from 1 May up to 7 May, through fixed and outreach sites in Old 
Fangak, one of the underserved counties in Jonglei State. Suspected measles cases this year have now reached 685, of 
which 73 cases have been confirmed by laboratory testing. To respond to the situation, a measles outbreak campaign 
is planned for  in  Malakal  PoC  site during  6-9  May,  targeting 10,500 children under 5,  while a national  campaign is 
scheduled for October.

Through routine immunization services, during the reporting period, 1,627 children were vaccinated with at least 3 
doses  of  pentavalent  vaccine,  1,490  with  Inactivated  Polio  Vaccine  and  2,236  with  measles  vaccine,  while  1,519 
pregnant women received their second dose of Tetanus Toxoid. Meanwhile, supplemental doses of polio and measles 
are given to children under 15 years through RRM missions and at PoC entry points. During the reporting period, 28,106 
children were vaccinated against measles and 63,931 children against polio.

UNICEF continues to provide cold chain and logistics support to the Ministry of Health (MoH) including installation, 
repair and maintenance of cold chain equipment. One solar fridge was recently installed and three were repaired in 
Pariang County. In addition, to implement the global switch from tOPV to bOPV, UNICEF supported transportation and.

distribution of 434,000 doses of bOPV to the seven stable states and 16 accessible counties out of 33 in the conflict-
affected states.

In  the  reporting  period,  67,577  curative  consultations  were  conducted,  bringing  the  total  number  of  health 
consultations  with  UNICEF  support  to  486,765  for  this  year.  These  consultations  have  been  carried  out  across  the 
country through static health facilities, community based care or RRMs. Forty five per cent of the consultations were 
provided to children under 5 with acute respiratory infection (ARI) and malaria continuing to be the leading causes of 
morbidity and mortality (26 per cent each of the total consultations). Efforts to control malaria continue by providing 
insecticide-treated  bed  nets  to  women  and  children.  An  additional  7,743  nets  were  provided  during  the  reporting 
period, bringing the total number distributed this year to 44,522. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) in Malakal PoC through 
UNICEF’s partner, Mentor Initiative, was completed with a 99.5 per cent coverage rate.

Optimal care during pregnancy remains UNICEF’s priority in light of its enduring consequences both to the mother and 
child. Since the beginning of the year, 10,040 pregnant women have had four recommended antenatal care (ANC) visits 
through  UNICEF  support,  including  1,720  completed  during  the  past  two  weeks.  In  addition,  1,947  pregnant  and 
lactating  women  have  been  screened  for  HIV,  of  which  23  were  positive  and  subsequently  started  anti-retroviral 
treatment (ART).

UNICEF  provided three tents  together  with  primary  health  care  kits,  antimalarial drugs and five hospital  beds  with 
mattresses  to  a  health  center  in  the  Wau  Shillluk  IDP  camp  to  be  used  for  general  consultations,  maternity  and 
paediatric units. In that safe and clean environment, a mother, 34 years old was able to give birth to her eighth child, 
a 3.5 kg baby born on 28 April. A total of 816 deliveries nationwide have been now been attended by skilled birth 
attendants for this reporting period.

As the rainy season approaches, activities are being undertaken both at facility and community levels to prepare for a 
possible cholera outbreak. These activities are planned in an integrated manner across all relevant program sectors 
(Health, WASH and C4D) in coordination with the respective Clusters. UNICEF has contributed to the finalization of the 
National Cholera Preparedness and Response Plan and continuously engages with the Clusters and technical working 
groups. Critical supplies have been prepositioned around identified hotspots based on the 2014 and 2015 outbreaks. 
An assessment of readiness at Juba Teaching Hospital, where most cases were managed in 2015, was jointly conducted 
with WHO and other partners, which identified gaps in resources across all the three sectors. UNICEF is responding to 
requests in terms of supplies and training of frontline health workers. To enhance coordination especially with its field 
offices, UNICEF formed an internal Cholera Taskforce that holds meetings on a weekly basis.

NUTRITION: UNICEF and partners have admitted 53,775 children for SAM from January to March 2016. This is a 40 
per cent increase over the same time period in 2015 and a third of the 2016 target. Over a third of the children were 
admitted  from  Northern  Bahr  el  Ghazal,  where  the  number  of  OTP  sites  has  been  increased  to  180,  providing  the 
treatment to children with SAM.

In Bentiu PoC, 5,433 children under 5 were screened during the reporting period, resulting in 3.4 per cent and 12.3 per 
cent of proxy SAM and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) rates. In areas surrounding the PoC, a significantly higher 
number of children under 5 were screened compared to the past as partners extended the activity at registration and.

food distribution site in Bentiu town. Out of 4,702 children screened, 206 children were identified with SAM (4.4 per 
cent) and 503 children were identified with MAM (10.7 per cent). There is an observed decrease in the proxy GAM rate 
as the previous reporting period showed 18.1 per cent.

Total Number Screened.

In Unity, a total of 53 OTP centers are operational, while 19 are currently suspended mainly in Mayendit (10) and Koch 
(6) with a few in Guit and Rubkona counties due to security reasons. During the past two weeks, 588 children were 
admitted for the treatment of SAM at OTP, while 79 SAM children with complications were referred to stabilization 
centers (SC) in Bentiu and surrounding areas. According to MSF, 12 deaths of children under 5 occurred with 3 deaths 
related to malnutrition. However the mortality rate is still below the emergency threshold at 0.42 deaths per 10,000 
per day.

In  Upper  Nile,  25,688  children  under  5  were  screened  for  malnutrition  during  the  past  two  weeks  across  different 
counties  in  the  state.  Among  them,  375  children  were  identified  with  SAM  (1.5  per  cent)  and  1,379  children  were 
identified with MAM (5.4 per cent). Out of 82 OTP sites targeted in the state, 72 are currently operational. During the 
reporting period, a total of 1,512 children with SAM or MAM were admitted to an OTP, SC or target supplementary 
feeding programme (TSFP). Of these, 47.1 per cent of them were SAM cases while the others were MAM cases.

In  Jonglei,  16,703  children  under  5  (7,999  boys  and  8,704 
girls)  were  screened  for  malnutrition  during  the  past  two 
weeks. 857 children (438 boys and 419 girls) were identified 
with  SAM  and  3,124  children  (1,615  boys  and  1,509  girls) 
were identified with MAM. A proxy GAM rate is 23.8 per cent 
while proxy SAM and MAM rates are 5.1 per cent and 18.7 
per cent respectively. A proxy GAM rate in Akobo was found 
to be above 30 per cent and indicates a very critical level of 
malnutrition. The recent SMART survey also indicated a GAM 
rate  above  the  emergency  threshold  and  there  could  be  a 
worsening  of  the  nutrition  situation.  Out  of  105  OTP  sites 
targeted,  99  are  currently  operational,  and  a  total  of  940 
children  with  SAM  were  admitted  during  the  past  two 
weeks.

In Western Bahr el Ghazal on 21 April, UNICEF participated in an integrated response to IDPs in Mboro village, where 
an estimated 8,000 people are reportedly living in the bush. On the day of the response around 3,000 IDPs benefited 
from humanitarian assistance. A total of 307 children were screened with proxy SAM and GAM rates of 1.6 per cent 
and 8.8 per cent respectively. In Wau, 10 OTP centers are currently disrupted. UNICEF’s partner, PSI, has been working 
together with WFP at an IDP verification and registration site since 23 April, where active screening of children under 
5 and pregnant and lactating women has been conducted. Malnutrition cases are referred to OTP centers in Bazia Jedit,.

to Wau Teaching Hospital.

In Warrap, social mobilization for scale up of nutrition response continued in all 6 counties and Abyei. There are 11 SC, 
89 OTP and 88 TSFP sites currently functioning, including 8 TSFP sites recently established by partner GOAL in Abyei. In 
the reporting period, 11,880 children under 5 (5,885 boys and 5,995 girls) were screened, of which 725 children (360 
boys and 365 girls) were identified with SAM and 3,234 children (1,672 boys and 1,562 girls) were identified with MAM. 
Similarly, 3,271 pregnant and lactating women were screened, of which 594 were identified with acute malnutrition.

The Nutrition Information Working Group has 
validated  10  SMART  surveys  in  2016,  the 
majority of which had GAM rates above 15 per 
cent, 
threshold. 
Additionally  10 
survey  proposals  were 
reviewed. The IPC update scheduled for April 
could  not  take  place.  Therefore,  partners 
agreed to conduct an integrated food security 
and nutrition analysis to be used internally for 
interventions,  which  started  from  19  April 
amid interruptions due to security restrictions.

WASH: The onset of the rainy season in the greater Bahr el Ghazal region is recharging shallow aquifers, resulting in 
shallow wells that had been dry becoming productive again. Likewise, some hand pumps which were performing poorly 
during the dry season have been revitalized and are producing relatively better water yields. Consequently, a significant 
reduction in waiting time for water collection and efforts to pump water from boreholes is apparent. However, the 
looming hunger situation continues to force people in the northern region to migrate to the neighbouring Republic of 
Sudan or other areas in search for food. This is hampering the sustainability of water user committees which also face 
challenges to collect fees. Community-led total sanitation (CLTS) activities are affected too as people are too weak to 
excavate latrine pits.

Safe  water  is  available  in  Bentiu  PoC  at  an 
average  of  13.4  liters  per  person  per  day 
(L/p/d), an increase from 11 L/p/d of the last 
report.  UNICEF  is  supporting  installation  of 
new  pumps  which  are  expected  to  further 
increase water supply to 21 L/p/d in Sector 4. 
Safe  water  supply  activities  are  ongoing 
outside  the Bentiu  PoC site  as well.  For the 
new surface water treatment (SWAT) system 
in  Rubkona  town,  a  2.2  km  distribution 
pipeline  was  prepositioned  and  plans  are 
underway to construct tap stands in order to 
supply  water 
in  high  density  areas. 
Rehabilitation of the water supply system at 
Bentiu Referral Hospital is continuing with a 
potential to supply 162,000 litres per day to the hospital and surrounding population in Biemrok village. During the 
past two weeks, 5 boreholes were repaired in Biemrok, Bilyang and Korbung villages.

In Malakal town, two SWAT systems keep operating normally with a daily production of 90,000 liters of treated water 
to support 5,000 IDPs, or 18 L/p/d. Ten latrine stances were completed to provide additional access to sanitation for 
500  IDPs.  In  the  past  two  weeks,  280  households  were  visited  for  hygiene  promotion,  reaching  1,485  people  (936 
females and 549 males) with key hygiene messages, and 800 grams of soap were distributed to 4,966 people during 
WFP’s general food distribution. Similarly in Wau Shilluk, 1,612 individuals (380 men, 452 women, 360 boys and 420 
girls) were reached with hygiene promotion messages, and a cleanup campaign was organized, attended by 403 women 
and 97 men.

South Sudan SITUATION REPORT 5 MAY 2016.

In Wau town, UNICEF supported the urban water system with fuel to allow it to continue to supply safe water to the 
ever growing population due to the influx of IDPs. In the meantime, the Wau State Water Corporation has endeavored 
to improve water tariff collection to extend its network to new residential areas so that the revenue is increased and 
fuel becomes affordable. An additional 5,000 people in Wau town and Jur River County, and 2,000 people in Agok and 
Twic Counties gained access to safe water through the repair of 10 water points and four water points respectively. An 
additional 250 people were provided with access to sanitation through the construction of two latrine blocks.

The WASH situation in Greater Pibor Administrative Area (GPAA) has seen a significant improvement with UNICEF’s 
implementing partners, Peace Corps, IAS and Nile Hope scaling up interventions both in the Pibor UNMISS base and 
surrounding  counties  of  Vertet  and  Lekuangole.  In  Boma  County,  construction  of  two  mini  water  yards  has  been 
completed and is awaiting the installation of solar system to make them operational. They have the potential to provide 
4,000 people with safe water. To provide hygiene and sanitation services, seven latrine stances were constructed in 
Hai Matar and Vertet which are now serving over 350 people. Hygiene promotion messages reached approximately 
750  people  in  GPAA.  A  total  of  six  hand  pumps  were  rehabilitated  in  Akoba  for  3,650  people,  in  Fangak  for  7,500 
households, and in Pibor for 500 people.

In Tambura County, Western Equatoria State, Aquatabs®, PUR® and information, education and communication (IEC) 
materials on hand washing, prevention of cholera and protection of water from contamination were delivered to 320 
households. In the same state, 50  families with  malnourished  children  were supported with  soap to  combat water 
borne diseases such as diarrhea. Another 500 inpatients including pregnant women and people living with HIV also 
benefitted from soap distribution in Nzara County Hospital and St. Bakhita Home.

UNICEF is working with partners to prepare for a potential outbreak of cholera. Cholera Preparedness Taskforces have 
been established in hotspots based on the past experience. In Aweil County, UNICEF donated tools for water quality 
testing  and  reagents  for  1,000  samples  to  implementing  partner  SNV.  Bacteriological  testing  will  commence 
immediately in warning areas of Chalek, Jaac and Werapei by collecting 50 samples from water sources and households 
in each location. Meanwhile,  hygiene promotion focused on  cholera prevention is ongoing, and 3,892 people were 
reached with key messages in Agok and Twic counties. To accelerate CLTS activities in Torit County, SNV carried out 
door-to-door  awareness  raising  campaigns  on  the  importance  of  using  latrines  to  avoid  cholera  outbreaks. 
Prepositioning of WASH contingency materials has been made available in Torit and is ongoing in other locations. In 
Bentiu, trainings of hygiene promoters on cholera prevention and response is planned.

EDUCATION: So far this year, UNICEF and partners have reached 142,508 children (35 per cent girls) with Education in 
Emergencies (EiE) support, including trainings, supplies and technical assistance and operating costs to partners.

In Jonglei State, as in most states, schools are administrating end-of-term examinations. To date, with support of all 
Education partners, 192 schools have been provided with EiE interventions, effectively reaching 70,731 children (35 
per cent girls) and 1,185 teachers (17 per cent females).  UNICEF conducted monitoring visits to Duk and Twic East 
counties and found that classrooms in Poktap Boma were occupied by teachers as living quarters and those in Ayueldit 
and Padiet Primary Schools were used to provide health services. Advocacy efforts were immediately started for the 
occupants to vacate the premises for teaching/learning to take place there.

In  Pibor,  about  250  households  who  sought  shelter  in  the 
UNMISS  base  during  the  March/April  tensions  still  remain; 
and  children  are  going  to  school  in  town  from  there.  All 
current schools are open in Pibor, Gumuruk, Lekuangole and 
Vertet  with  registration  ongoing.  Vertet  is  presenting  a 
problem of low enrolment of girls. This is due to the fact that 
the  only  school  has  no  latrines  or  water  points,  which 
discourages girls from attending. UNICEF is looking to engage 
with more partners to access Vertet and to improve the situation. To integrate children formerly associated with armed 
groups into education, life skills and livelihood opportunities, UNICEF, in partnership with Nile Hope, has facilitated 
accelerated learning programme (ALP) classes for 152 learners (7 girls), including 11 released children in three centres 
in Pibor Boys, Kondako and Langachot Primary Schools.

In Unity State, the “Beyond Bentiu” strategy is progressing as UNICEF opened four primary schools in Guit County for 
the  first  time  since  fighting  erupted  in  December  2013.  So  far  2,581  children  (40  per  cent  girls)  are  attending  the.

schools.  With  more  BTL  2  campaigns  taking  place,  the  target  of  5,000  children  should  be  realised.  Meanwhile,  the 
majority of schools remain closed in Koch County as most people that fled the area have not yet returned. “Beyond 
Bentiu” is an inter-cluster strategy to expand service delivery and static humanitarian presence beyond the Bentiu POC, 
to areas where there are concentration of IDPs and humanitarian needs.

In Malakal PoC and Wau Shilluk, registration is continuing and efforts are being made to accommodate all children by 
re-opening schools destroyed during the incident in February as well as by advocating for more spaces allocated to 
establish temporary learning spaces (TLS). A request was submitted for spaces in PoC Sector 2 and 4, whilst Sector 5 
is also being prepared as a new site. Making use of the presence of the Division of Gender and Social Welfare within 
the restructured State Ministry of Education (SMoE), Gender and Social Welfare, more synergies between education 
and gender interventions are being explored. This will be achieved through close collaboration with gender actors to 
include cross-cutting issues like gender-based violence (GBV), girls’ education etc. from the planning stage.

A launch of BTL 2 took place at Aweil National Primary School, 
Northern Bah el Ghazal State on 27 April. About 10,000 people 
attended the launch including students from 29 schools, their 
parents, teachers, community leaders and UN representatives.  
Ms. Siama Danga, Director of Gender of SMoE emphasized the 
need for parents to send their children to school, saying “A pen is 
not heavy like a gun. Let us leave guns and hold pens”. 
Another BTL 2 launch took place in Yambio, Western Equatoria 
State on 5 May.

In Lakes, the long-awaited secondary school leaving examinations 
for both Sudan and South Sudan curriculums have been completed 
with 1,467 learners (250 girls) sitting the test out of 1,497 (252 girls) 
registered. This means 97 per cent of registered learners took the 
examinations, and that almost all the registered girls (99 per cent) 
participated. While in Central Equatoria State, UNICEF with 
implementing partner NRC, supported 739 students (67 girls) to sit 
the examinations.

Girls receiving dignity kits in Roordit Primary School.

In the Mingkaman IDP camp, 515 girls were presented with dignity kits in Roordit, Panhial, Tomrok and Thonachak 
Primary Schools with UNICEF’s support through NRC. These kits will contribute significantly to their regular school 
attendance and retention as well as their general well-being.

CHILD PROTECTION: Since the beginning of the conflict in December 2013, a total of 12,593 cases of unaccompanied, 
separated and missing children have been registered by UNICEF and other Child Protection actors, of which 47 per cent 
are girls. 8,884 cases or 71 per cent are active cases which require family tracing and reunification (FTR) services as well 
as follow-up visits while the other cases have been closed as a result of finalised family reunification or other causes 
such as  children moving out  of the  country.  Reunification flights remain a  challenge. Although UNICEF is  arranging 
between six to 10 flights a day, delays or cancellations happen for various reasons including poor weather and security 
constraints, but also due to disruptions caused by insufficient funds. These have impacted over 20 children in the past 
month.  Without  additional  funds  beyond  June  2016,  case  management  and  family  reunification  will  be  reduced 
substantially, reaching  only 25 per  cent of the  active  caseload. This  will  leave  over 6,500 children unable  to access 
services, exposing them to greater protection risks due to prolonged family separation.

As a lead agency and coordinator for GBV interventions in Upper Nile State, UNICEF supported the SMoE, Gender and 
Social  Welfare  to  organize  the  first  coordination  meeting  in  Malakal  town  since  the  start  of  the  crisis.  UNICEF,  in 
collaboration with other protection actors, also trained 17 leaders from community watch groups in Malakal PoC on 
referral options for GBV survivors and the guiding principles of survivor-centred response. During the reporting period, 
3,785 people were reached in Malakal PoC, Malakal town and Wau Shilluk with messages on the consequences of GBV,.

services for survivors and the importance of timely reporting to access life-saving services. In addition, 1,109 women 
and girls accessed psychosocial support (PSS) and skills building courses in three women centers. In Fashoda County, 
where the GBV programme resumed in February as access was granted, 60 women and girls benefited from a newly 
opened women and girls’ center. Additionally, 901 community members (733 females and 168 males) were reached 
with awareness messages on gender roles, domestic violence, forced marriage and available GBV response services in 
Kodok. Case management and PSS services are ongoing in two women and girls’ centers in Mandeng and Jikmir; and 
the GBV referral pathway has been updated in Mandeng to facilitate GBV survivors to access available services.

Building on a model rolled out by the Communities Care programme, in Pariang County, four community engagement 
groups  exploring  GBV  related  social  norms  continue  their  15  weeks  of  community  dialogues.  Ninety-one  group 
members attended the meetings discussing traditional norms, beliefs, behaviours and rules related to sexual violence 
within their community. In Central Equatoria State, 183 people (49 women, 7 men, 93 girls and 34 boys) were reached 
with  GBV  awareness  messages  and  48  others  benefited  from  PSS  activities  in  women  centers  in  Juba  IDP  sites.  In 
Yambio, 1,349 people (1,013 women and 336 men) were reached with GBV awareness sessions conducted at three 
health facilities. A clinical management of rape (CMR) training was conducted in Leer County for 65 health workers.

Mine risk education (MRE) in temporary learning spaces, PoC and communities in Upper Nile (Ulang, Pagak, Melut, 
Kodok) and Unity (Nimni Payam, Guit County) were the focus of MRE efforts this fortnight, where approximately 11,025 
people (3,773 boys, 3,380 girls, 2,055 men and 1,817 women) were reached. In an effort to scale up MRE in schools, 
UNICEF and the National Mine Action Authority (NMAA) have conducted a mapping of schools and is now working with 
other mine action partners to assign locations and encourage them to commence in areas where gaps are identified. 
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between NMAA, UNICEF and UNMAS, which sets a framework 
for the provision of assistance to strengthen MRE capacities and improve efficacy of MRE service in South Sudan.

A team comprising NDDRC, SPLA CPU, UNMISS and UNICEF is currently in Bentiu, preparing the ground for release of 
children from SPLA. Initial screening has identified 16 children who will be released later this month, with screening of 
Mankien  and  Mayom  barracks  expected  to  conclude  this  week.  UNICEF  is  now  working  with  partners  to  make  the 
necessary preparations for interim care, PSS and FTR services. On the side of the SPLA in Opposition, child protection 
focal  points  have  been  formally  assigned  and  a  UNMISS  and  UNICEF  team  will  travel  to  Pagak  later  this  month  to 
conduct the initial capacity building and then commence identification, screening and registration exercise for children 
associated with the forces based in the headquarters in Pagak.

At least 32 of the over 100 children abducted from Gambella Region in Ethiopia in April have reportedly been recovered 
in Lekuangole County. A UNICEF Child Protection Specialist is being deployed to assess how UNICEF and other agencies 
can provide necessary care and support until the children can be returned to their families.

COMMUNICATION FOR DEVELOPMENT (C4D): In preparation for a possible cholera outbreak, MoH, WHO, UNICEF 
and  partners  are  engaging  with  media  organizations  and  telecom  companies  to  disseminate  messages  on  cholera 
prevention and control. A designated cholera hotline has been provide by Vivacell Telecom Company. The broadcasting 
key  messages  through  bulk  SMS  will  start  shortly.  With  UNICEF  support,  84  trained  social  mobilizers  and  team 
supervisors from SMoH of Central Equatoria State continue with focus group discussions, educating communities on 
cholera prevention and control in high risk residential areas of Juba city. On 23-27 April, the mobilizers conducted 62 
sessions  reaching  5,153  people  including  school  children  with  critical  messages  in  the  areas  of  Nyakuron,  Munuki, 
Northern Bari and Juba Block. Other high risk areas to be covered include Gondoroko Island, Rejaf and Kator.

UNICEF  C4D  and  Health  teams  commemorated  World  Malaria  Day  on  25  April,  conducted  advocacy  activities  on 
inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and supported vaccination and advocacy activities during African Vaccination Week on 
24-30  April.  In  nine  counties  of  Unity  State,  a  team  of  3,413  social  mobilizers  were  trained  on  skills  to  educate 
communities on practices to prevent and control malaria and on the importance of IPV and immunization. In Jonglei 
State across almost all counties including Bor PoC, Northern Jonglei and Pibor, over 360 trained social mobilizers have 
reached 72,000 households with key messages on polio, malaria, hygiene and sanitation. In response to measles cases 
in Malakal, 25 social mobilizers from the PoC were trained on how to conduct social mobilization campaigns.

SUPPLY & LOGISTICS: During the reporting period, supplies valued at US$700,000 were dispatched to partners and 
various  warehouses  country  wide  for  distribution.  Over  100  MT  of  ready-to-use-therapeutic  foods  (RUTF),  F-75 
therapeutic milk and Vitamin A tablets were delivered to implementing partners for the management of malnutrition 
in their respective areas of operation. Delivery of the nutrition supplies in hard-to-reach areas such as Nyal was made.

possible  with  the  support  of  the  Logistics  Cluster  using  their  air-assets.  UNICEF  also  chartered  flights  for  supply 
transportation  to  Pariang.  Six  trucks  loaded  with  nutrition  supplies  consigned  to  Save  the  Children  and  education 
materials for BTL 2 were dispatched to Jonglei via a humanitarian road convoy. The total value of nutrition supplies 
dispatched amounted to US$400,000. 3,360 collapsible jerry cans for water collection and storage were received by 
UNHCR for programme implementation in Ajang Thok. Two trucks loaded with WASH supplies were dispatched to State 
Ministry of Housing and Public Utilities in Eastern Equitoria; 9,000 cartons of soap for improved hygiene in the PoC 
were transported to Bentiu for distribution by Concern World Wide. As part of BTL 2, 50 school-in-a-box kits for over 
2,000 students were delivered to UNICEF implementing partner in Tonj East. The total value of WASH and Education 
supplies dispatched was US$250,000. As part of an effort to treat and prevent malaria, various malaria medicines and 
2,500 mosquito nets were dispatched to SMoH in  Juba. EPI ancillary supplies were delivered to SMoH in Jonglei to 
support campaigns in the state.

FUNDING: Against the Humanitarian Action for Children (HAC) appeal requirement of US$ 154.5 million, UNICEF has 
received US$ 47 million (30 per cent funded). UNICEF would like to thank ECHO for the generous contribution of EUR 
8.5 million which will enable UNICEF and its partners to scale up the critical humanitarian interventions in the areas 
of nutrition, child protection, education and health. A contribution of $859K was also received from the CERF for 
nutrition activities which is also highly appreciated.

1 Partner reporting rates remain below 100 per cent; UNICEF continues to work with its implementing partners to improve monitoring and reporting of results. 
2 WASH, Child Protection and Education Clusters validate cluster members’ results monthly. To provide up-to-date snapshot, UNICEF may report tentative results 
bi-weekly before validated by the Clusters. 
3 UNICEF annual targets for child protection and education are higher than those fixed in the Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP) as UNICEF requirements are 
higher than the inter-agency appeal. 
4 The Nutrition Cluster target does not include refugee children who are covered under the Multi-Sector Refugee Appeal. 
5 UNICEF’s nutrition response covers all children, including refugee children residing in the country. 
6 Critical child protection services include psychosocial support delivered through Child Friendly Space (CFS) or community based mechanisms, case management 
and prevention messaging targeting children and adolescents at risk of recruitment, family separation or other child protection risks.
