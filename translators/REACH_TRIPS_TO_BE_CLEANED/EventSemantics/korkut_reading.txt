Melanoma cell proliferation was inhibited by either BAY43-9006 or rapamycin over the 0.01 - 100 nM concentration range . ++++ Regardless of B-Raf mutational status , the combination of low dose rapamycin and BAY43-9006 synergistically inhibited melanoma cell proliferation . ++++ Combining Rapamycin with BAY43-9006 synergistically inhibits serum dependent proliferation of melanoma cells . ++++ However , our data show that melanoma cell proliferation is effectively inhibited in vitro by low doses of rapamycin . ++++ In every cell line examined , combination of BAY43-9006 and rapamycin produced synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation compared to either drug alone . ++++ Serum stimulated proliferation of multiple human melanoma cell lines was inhibited by BAY43-9006 and by rapamycin . ++++ BAY43-9006 and rapamycin inhibit proliferation of melanoma cells . ++++ Therefore , nanomolar concentrations of either BAY43-9006 or rapamycin inhibit the proliferation of melanoma cells , whether or not they have mutated B-Raf . ++++ Here we show that serum stimulated melanoma cell proliferation is inhibited by either rapamycin or BAY43-9006 , with B-Raf V599E mutants showing an increased sensitivity to each drug at 10 nM compared to melanoma cells with wild-type B-Raf .
Serum stimulated proliferation of multiple human melanoma cell lines was inhibited by BAY43-9006 and by rapamycin .
In cardiomyocytes , PKC dependent activation of mTOR and p70S6K was inhibited by U0126 , implicating a requirement for MEK [ XREF_BIBR ] .
