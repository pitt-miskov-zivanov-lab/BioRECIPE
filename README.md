# BioRECIPE Package README
The BioRECIPE (Biological system Representation for Evaluation, Curation, Interoperability, Preserving, and Execution) knowledge representation format was introduced to facilitate seamless human-machine interaction while creating, verifying, evaluating, curating, and expanding executable models of intra- and intercellular signaling. This format allows a human user to easily preview and modify any model component, while it is at the same time readable by machines and can be processed by a suite of model development and analysis tools. The BioRECIPE format is compatible with multiple representation formats, machine readers, modeling tools, and databases that are used by the systems biology community. 
All the details for use of BioRECIPE are provided in the documentation: https://melody-biorecipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html.
